# Adaptive and Facade Pattern

1. Adaptive Pattern

    Create an adapter from Turkey to Duck, so that we can use APIs that only accept Duck.

    P243 

    **The Adaptive Pattern** converts the interface of a class into another interface the client expect.
    Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incomplatible interfaces.

2. Facade Pattern

    This pattern seems very simple. Just a collection of interface and related functions.

    Check P262, P264...

    **The Facade Pattern** provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. 
    Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
