# Iterator Pattern

The implementation in C++ is far more difficult than Java where all the object is in-heap...

Not that familar with std::shared_ptr, I create a shared_ptr to shared_ptr to store the MenuItem.

Also use dynamic_pointer_cast...

## The Iterator Pattern

**The Iterator Pattern** provides a way to access the elements of an 
aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation.

## Design Principle

A class should have only one reason to change.

Can also use a Menu interface so that all different menus will implement it.


## The Composite Pattern

**The Composite pattern** allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of object uniformly.

P358

The Composite Pattern is easy to implement and smart. Allow a tree structure.

CompositeIterator is omitted.
